I've tried out Day One but I don't really feel like it offers me anything better than I get with Obsidian.

I mean, why switch to a more limited app for that task specifically?  Plus, I can't link between journal entries and the rest of my vault.

Only downsides I can see are less metadata (what specifically?)
