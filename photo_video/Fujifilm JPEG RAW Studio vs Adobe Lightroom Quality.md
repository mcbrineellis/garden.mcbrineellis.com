The quality of JPGs produced by the Fujifilm JPG engine is much higher than the quality of edited Fujifilm RAF RAW files exported from Adobe Lightroom.  I believe this is due to Lightroom's poor handlingÂ of X-Trans RAW files.

I used Lightroom for a decent amount of time but ended up switching back to a JPEG-only workflow just out of convenience.
