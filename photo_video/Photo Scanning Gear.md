### Film Holders and Copy Tables

Ebay copy table... about $250.

Negative Supply makes copy stands, lights, carriers.

My question is, if I have individual frames (not even cut strips) how would I go about scanning those?  Most of my 35 is at least in cut strips of 4 frames.  And just about all of my medium format is cut into individual frames.
