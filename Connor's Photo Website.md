## Blog style photo site
Cargo (https://u.cargo.site/designlab) is what my friend Emily uses: https://mlybitar.com
# My current setup

Currently my blog is running on Hugo & GitHub pages, it’s not really suiting either purpose very well. Either purpose being: 
1. photo showcase
2. blog (articles about tech, OR photos)

**Hugo as a blog frustrations**
- It’s just a static site generator, not a full CMS
- No easy way to post from different devices
- No drafts management
- Images have to be hosted somewhere else like Flickr (can’t store a ton of files in GitHub…)
- Kind of cool from a techie standpoint but not actually something I enjoy using (otherwise I’d be posting on there more often)

**Hugo as a photo site frustrations**
- no such thing as a gallery
- No way to easily restrict access
