I posted a comment on this video 12 years ago asking, and the guy finally replied to me with his drum cymbal & recording setup.  I really liked the sound I guess:

**Cymbals:** Paiste 2002s - 17", 18" crashes; 18" china; 22" ride. 
**Drums:** Yamaha 14"x 6.5" snare, OLD Pearl shells (14" & 18" toms, 22"x16" kick). 
**Mics:** Kick mic is a D112 - and no, I didn't buy it because of a similarly-titled Rush album ;-) Tom mics are Sennheizer 421s, snare mic is a 57. Overheads were Shure SM81s, and there's a room mic - a CAD Trion tube condenser mic.
