Throw in OxiClean white revive laundry stain remover powder with each load to keep white shirts looking fresh.
## Removing Pit Stains
Taken from a video Brandon sent me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwRByv3Zkw

**Ingredients:**
- 1 teaspoon of Hydrogen Peroxide
- 1 teaspoon of Blue Dawn Dish Soap
- 1 teaspoon of Baking Soda

Mix it into a paste, apply it to the stains.

Peroxide has mild bleaching property, so be careful (test) on non-white shirts.
Ideally, let it sit overnight.  If not overnight, then at least for a couple hours.

## Using Bleach

You can't use Bleach on non-white items obviously, but even with white shirts you have to be careful they are bleach-safe fabric.

1. Be sure you only wash bleach-safe fabrics in your bleach load, like items made from cotton, polyester, nylon, and acrylic.
2. Watch out for garments with fiber types that are not safe for bleach–you should never bleach textiles made with wool, silk, mohair, leather, and spandex.  Even a small amount of spandex blended with another fiber can yellow when washed with bleach.
3. We recommend ⅓ cup for a regular size load with an average soil level, and ⅔ cup for an extra-large or heavily soiled load in a standard washer.
