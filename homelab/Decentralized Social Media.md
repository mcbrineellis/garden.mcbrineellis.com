I don't really know what to make of the current state of the "fediverse", as it's called...

It all seems like a bit of a mess, and Twitter was already a mess... anyways, [I'm on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mcbrineellis.bsky.social) but not really actively using it at the moment.  I would love to see decentralization and federation work for social media but I don't know if it will take off besides the sort of people who are already using these platforms heavily.

I mean if I can't make sense of it myself, why should Joe Blow care?
