September is moving along nicely and it's time to finish up what I started a couple weeks ago.

- I need the router so I can move my stuff off to a separate IP range.
- Found a cool new Jellyfin client: https://github.com/fredrikburmester/streamyfin
- I want to learn more about OpenTelemetry with Grafana: https://grafana.com/go/webinar/mastering-code-based-instrumentation-with-opentelemetry-and-grafana/
