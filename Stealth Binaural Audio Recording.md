I used to own a Zoom H1 recorder which was super portable and I recorded a few shows with it.  A friend has had good success recording with a Zoom F1.
## Roland CS-10EM
These are combination earbud-microphone and can record at decent audio quality when connected to a recorder that can supply plug-in power.
