Maximalism isn't always the best.  Minimalism is probably better suited for more people even if it doesn't get that much attention.

Bodybuilding guy gave his bro 1 push, 1 pull, 1 leg exercise per week.

Let's learn how to train like a minimalist.

- Strength
- Health
- Muscle mass
## Strength

1 heavy set done 1-3x per week will induce significant strength gains for most people.

Most important thing is *exposure to heavy loads*.

Get away with very little total lifting - as long as it's very heavy, in the 1-5 rep zone.

30-60 minutes per week is enough to obtain "maximum risk reduction" in terms of all-cause mortality, CVD, and total cancer.
