## Steps

1. **Prepare Ingredients:** Have all your ingredients measured and ready.
2. **Remove Chicken Skin:**
    - Hold each drumstick by the bone end and use a paper towel to get a firm grip on the skin.
    - Pull the skin down toward the thicker end of the drumstick and off. If the skin is stubborn, you can use a small knife to help start the peel or cut away any connective tissue holding the skin to the meat.
    - Once all drumsticks are skinned, proceed with the recipe. Optionally, pat them dry with paper towels.
3. **Curry Base:** Set your cooking pot to Sauté mode on high. Add the oil and temper the cinnamon, cloves, ground black pepper, and bay leaves. If using, add a pinch of nutmeg or cinnamon now.
4. **Sauté Onions:** Add the sliced onions with a bit of salt, cooking until golden brown.
5. **Ginger Garlic Paste:** Stir in the ginger garlic paste and cook until the raw smell dissipates.
6. **Add Dry Spices:** Include the salt, turmeric, red chilli, Kashmiri chilli, coriander, cumin, and meat masala powders. Sauté on a low flame.
7. **Incorporate Tomatoes:** Add the canned tomatoes. If they are whole, crush or chop them before adding. Cook until the mixture thickens slightly.
8. **Mix in Yoghurt:** Smoothly blend in the yoghurt.
9. **Add Drumsticks:** Place the skinned drumsticks into the pot, ensuring they are well coated with the sauce. Adjust water as necessary, considering the moisture content of the canned tomatoes.
10. **Pressure Cook:** Switch to Pressure Cook on high for 10 minutes. Once completed, allow for a Natural Pressure Release (NPR) for 5 minutes, then quick release.
11. **Adjust Consistency:** If the curry is too liquid, use the Sauté function to reduce it to your liking.
12. **Final Touches:** Sprinkle with pepper and fenugreek leaves before serving.
