# Marathon Details

- [Website](https://www.torontowaterfrontmarathon.com/)
- [Course Map](https://www.torontowaterfrontmarathon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/TWM2023-map-Oct12-2023.pdf)

The 2024 Half-Marathon and Marathon races are on October 20th, 2024.  So I imagine 2025 will be in October as well.

# Training

I will do a similar training plan to what I did for the 2023 Fukuoka Marathon.
I think going on group runs with other folks (find group runs on [r/RunTO](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunTO)?) would be motivating!
