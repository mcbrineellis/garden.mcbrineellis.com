## Rehearsal Studio List
- **AMusikZone** (Broadview & Danforth) I emailed this guy today to see about Drum practice, so if it seems good I might be booking Monday evenings here on a regular basis :)
- **Cicada Room** (Pape & Mortimer) https://instagram.com/cicadaroom
- **Lynx Music** (Lansdowne & Dupont)
- **Main Stage Rehearsal** (Dufferin and Dupont, former rehearsal factory location near Lynx) https://mainstagerehearsal.com/explore-studios-toronto/
- **Best Deal In Town** (The Docks)
	- 416-834-9030
- **Jam Chamber Rehearsal Studio** (located near Downsview Park, so possibly rly convenient for polson, and still easy enough for me to get to as it's near the subway too).  Place looks nice.
- **Primal Note** (Dufferin & Eglinton) https://primalnote.com/
- **DC Music** (by Kipling subway) it's really close to my work's office, so on days that I'm in I could go there afterwards to practice drums pretty easily... but a bit far still in general.
