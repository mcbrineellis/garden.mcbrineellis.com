>My experience is to just tuck yourself away on land not being used. I've even used quieter parks in towns, throwing up the tent as the sun goes down so almost no one will see me. Never had a problem. Think most people's mentality is that as long as you aren't causing a problem and up and away fair early in the morning, they won't report you to any one.

>I guess I've gone stealth camping just with the background acceptance that I may be asked to move on at an odd hour, and just accept that.
