What is the goal?
*Take the input I consume and turn it into output.*

**Big picture - goal and process**

Don't reinvent the wheel, doing it systematically.
Stop going back to the same source trying to find a point. 

5 step process:
1. Capture notes
2. Process notes
3. Connect notes
4. Produce output
5. Gather reactions & conversations

1. Capturing notes

Two types of notes:
- Fleeting notes
Anything that pops up ... shower thoughts that disappear fast.
- Literature notes
Anything that I consume, I want to take notes and record sources!

Take notes, without judgement, on anything that I find interesting.

Become aware of having fleeting thoughts..

1. We can actively practice observing thoughts.
2. We can't judge the usefulness of an idea statically.

If it interests you, it's a good signal that it should be in your Zettelkasten.  If it's an orphan idea, you can purge it... but you may find a connection later on.

Folders?  How you organize vs how you retrieve.

She retrieves via tags & search.. not folders, so she doesn't organize that way.  Everything is in the root folder.

**Processing notes**

1. Make notes atomic
2. Make notes search friendly

When capturing notes, not necessarily atomic off the bat.

Atomic ... idea fit on an index card?

To make sure it's atomic... 3 ways:
- Questions
- Ideas
- Supplementary tools

Main idea, then supplementary info.
