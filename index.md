Welcome to my Digital Garden - a place to share my notes on a variety of subjects, in hopes they might be helpful to someone else.

It's kind of like how the internet used to be, before the age of social media.

Sort of like a real garden, this website is a work in progress.  Some notes may be incomplete.  Consider yourself warned :)

You can check out my Homelab [[Captain's Log]] to read about some of my latest adventures in [self-hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) my own "cloud" services.

## How did I make this website?

This website lives in a folder on my laptop and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is my text editor of choice.

I host the site on Github Pages and publish it using Github Actions & [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz).

I really wasn't a fan of the default Quartz folder structure - specifically I wanted to keep my website data separate from the Quartz app.

So, I did some research and found a [guide](https://catcodeme.github.io/1100_blog_content/others/publish-workflow) on the Quartz discord that explains how to use Git submodules to keep your QuartzÂ app and website content repos separate!  Thanks `catcodeme` for the help!
