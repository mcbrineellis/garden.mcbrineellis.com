This is a place for me to share notes in hopes they might be helpful to someone else.  You will likely find a lot of partial notes & half baked ideas in here, please don't judge me too harshly :)

I am using Obsidian as an editor, publishing using a combo of Github Actions & [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz).

I really wasn't a fan of the default Quartz folder structure.  I did some digging around and followed steps shared by a clever person on the Quartz discord explaining how to use [Git submodules](https://catcodeme.github.io/1100_blog_content/others/publish-workflow) to keep your QuartzÂ and Content repositories separated!  Thanks `catcodeme`!
