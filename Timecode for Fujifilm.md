Fujifilm recently added an update for the X-H2S camera to allow support for Timecode over Bluetooth using an "UltraSync Blue" device.

Having proper timecode on my video footage would be great, so will be researching this further...

> You need an Ultrasync One plus an Ultrasync Blue plus a BTA-1 adapter to jam a camera with a Zoom F3.
