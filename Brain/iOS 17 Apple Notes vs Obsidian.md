Benefits of Apple Notes over Obsidian?
- Inline attachments. I wouldn’t need any attachments folder. Idk about you but that is super annoying for me.
- Easier text styling. You can use keyboard shortcuts vs having to type in several asterisks or underlines or whatever. Plus, you can underline text… markdown left this out cause it conflicts with links. 
- Easier syncing. I don’t have to remember to push to github. It just syncs between all of my devices.
- Real apple pencil support. Excalidraw is lackluster because of how it works and because of the plugin Obsidian uses, “real” support is never an option for Obsidian. You can draw and import a picture/pdf what what you draw or use handwriting to text which I’ve never had good experiences with.
