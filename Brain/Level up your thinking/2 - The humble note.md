## Note-making (vs note-taking)

Let's save some of the awesome stuff we’re thinking about.  Because we have good ideas every now and then :)

David Allen said “Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.” We can offload the burden of "remembering" to our notes.

**_A note is a container of thought_**.

- Paradigm # 1: 🍯 **Notes are containers of thought** 💭
    You can put anything inside—a journal, a grocery list, an idea…anything.

- Paradigm # 2: 🎶 **Notes expand our cognitive surface area** 🤯
	Notes enable you to extend your mind. They can act as a sort of "cognitive scaffolding" that supports our thinking efforts, basically allowing us to extend the available surface area of our thinking.

- Paradigm # 3: 🗣 **Notes allow conversations across time** ⌛️
	Notes allow your old self to send messages to your future self.	Your Present Self is having a conversation with your Old Self. Your old self can re-inspire you, help you rediscover your way, or remind you of a really great idea.

- Paradigm # 4: 🌱 **Notes can change** 🌲
	Notes are not paved in concrete. Notes can & should evolve over time.

- Paradigm # 5: ✨ **Notes are for thinking** 🚀
	Notes are not for collecting. Notes are for helping you think.

Our notes can easily become a graveyard of other people's ideas, and old to-do lists, instead of a guilt-free "ideation chamber".

We might have fixated on "collecting" junk into our notes library.  
	- Do we KNOW those ideas we've collected?
	- Can we effectively work with these ideas?
	- Can we effectively talk about these ideas?

We don't need **more knowledge**, we need to **develop the knowledge we already have**.

**Note takers** are passive, staying on the sidelines.
Note takers often take "just-in-time" notes that are thrown away after their specific short-term purpose ends (test or project), because they lose their value.

**Note makers** engage with the ideas they encounter and get their hands dirty.

Linking, Thinking, Learning, Writing, Creating...These activities can't help but produce inherent feelings of joy and meaning.  You can still be a professional and spend time wandering and wondering, for the sake of it.
