One word is all it takes to become prolific: *"Because"*. 
 
In the classic film, The Wizard of Oz, the four main characters are "off to see the wizard...because, because, because, because, becauuussse........of all the wonderful things he does!"
 
Basically, they have no clue what the Wizard does. But because they say "because" they compel themselves to answer. And even if their answer is super fuzzy, saying "because" gives them a frame for understanding the world and their place in it.
 
We can do that too. If we start connecting ideas and experiences with "because," we can uncover the "wonderful things" that our thoughts and actions have to offer, both to ourselves and to the world around us.

- Catch yourself thinking about something.
	- Say "because".
	- Note how you answer.
- By prompting yourself with "because"...you are compelling yourself to respond.
	- The hidden power of "because" lies in its ability to _make a_ **_relationship_** _between ideas_.
