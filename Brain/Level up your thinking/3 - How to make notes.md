As we think, we naturally make notes in our mind.  Our mind just isn't great at storing those long term.

Note-making is the process of taking these mental notes and making our thinking **visible**.

It it's visible, we can build with it.

What are the differences between note-taking and note-making?

**Note-taking**
- quickly captured, other people's words, passive
- FOMO-mentality: "Fear Of Missing Out"
- EIEO-dynamic: "Easy In, Easy Out" 

**Note-making**
- mindfully made, your words, active
- JOMO-mentality: "Joy Of Missing Out"
- MIMO-dynamic: "Mindfully In, Magically Out"

Okay, so how do I do this.
1. Notice when you say "that's interesting" to yourself
2. Instead of being passive, ask yourself 4 questions:
	1. "that reminds me of x because" (connective)
	2. "that's similar to x because" (lateral)
	3. "that's different to x because" (critical)
	4. "that's important because" (personal)

### Two ways to note-take

When you feel a spark, "lean into it".

1. Outside-in (NoMa)
2. Inside-out (freewriting)

Freewriting is ... freely writing.  Typing, typing, etc... and what comes out doesn't really matter, but eventually something comes out that sparks ✨.

Notes about ideas can be categorized into two types:
- Thing notes
	- Concepts & noun-like Things.  Kubernetes, Music, Friendship.  Idk.
- Statement notes
	- Opinions, observations about said Things.
	- These should be really clearly stated, to force you to think what it is exactly you're trying to say.
