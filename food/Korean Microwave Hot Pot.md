Korean "microwave" [hot pot](https://www.instagram.com/p/C5ivXfyLC49/)
#### Ingredients
In order of adding to the pot:
- Bean sprouts
- Bok choy?
- thin sliced beef (or... pork belly)
- 1 tsp minced garlic
- 1 tbsp honey
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- black pepper
- cabbage
- 1/2 cup water

Instead of microwaving, I could make it in a pot
